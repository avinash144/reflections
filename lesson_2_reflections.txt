What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-> It creates a tracking hidden file and it will we used to track our files in
the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

->Repository is the snapshot of working directory which goes through called 
staging. So using staging concept we can add small changes in the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

-> We can do all changes(in all/few files) until it is suitable to commit, once
after that we can commit them

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

-> Branches can be helpful to make some experimental changes(not sure whether it
may work or not) and some different versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

-> We can understand the path we have taken to make latest commit and also we 
will know the parent of the commits.
