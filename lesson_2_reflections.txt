What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-> It creates a tracking hidden file and it will we used to track our files in
the repositiory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

->Repository is the snapshot of working directory which goes through called 
staging. So using staging concept we can add small changes in the repo.
