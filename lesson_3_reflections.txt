When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

-> When collaborating with others and when we are working from different systems

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> Because we will make so many changes in local directory and causes 
overloading the server

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

-> Fork is like clone but it is done in Github. This creates some side effects 
like increasing number of forkes in the original repo.

Clone is nothing but duplicating to local repo from either Github/another 
location on local repo.

Branch is used when we are doing some experimental changes or doing collbrative 
work with others.
